********************************************* ABSTRACT - CLASS *******************************************

- Abstract classes are used to define common functionality and bheaviour that can be shaired.
- Abstract class are used to define common Functionality and behaviour that can be shaired by subclasses.
- Abstract class in java we cannot create object of the class, methods in abstract class are meant to be subclassed.
- Abstract class containes * Abstract Methods.
                           * Concrete Methods.
                           * Static Menthos.
                           * Constructors

- * Abstract Methods :- The methods are stated with abstract Keyword.
                        and dont have any implementation only declartion.
                        Abstract Method should have any return type.

- * Concrete Methods :- The Fully Defined methods Normal Java methods with full method declarationa and Implementaion.

- * Static Method    :- we can use static methods in abstract class, Static method we cannot override.
                        They are belongs to class not To instance.
                        Static Method will Provide common utilty or Helper functionality.
                        Static Methods in abstract class can have any return type.



- *** Scenarios where we use Abstract Class

1. Use an Abstract Class When:

ðŸ’¡ You want to provide a base class with some shared functionality.
ðŸ’¡ You need to define instance variables that subclasses share.
ðŸ’¡ You need constructors to initialize common fields.
ðŸ’¡ You want to enforce a template pattern with default behavior.

âœ… Example Scenario:

Real-World Example: Vehicle System
Every vehicle has wheels, speed, and fuel type â†’ Define in an abstract class.
fuelType() method is abstract because different vehicles use different fuels.
The accelerate() method is concrete because all vehicles accelerate similarly.




Q] How Is a Constructor Allowed in an Abstract Class If It Cannot Be Instantiated?
âœ… Yes, an abstract class can have a constructor!

ðŸ”¹ Reason:
While an abstract class cannot be instantiated, it can be extended by subclasses.
The constructor of the abstract class is called when a subclass object is created,
allowing common fields or setup to be initialized.




* Static Constructor Not Allowed :- Java does not support static constructors (use static blocks instead)
