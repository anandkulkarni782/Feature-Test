*******************************************JAVA-STRING****************************************************

@] String :-

* String in java is sequence of characters
* Strings are immutable, Once created cannot be changed.

@] Ways To Create String

* There are two ways to create string in java

  1] Using String Literal

  String str = "Anand";

  2] Using New Keyword;

  String str = new String("Anand");

  3] Using String Builder and String Buffer for Modification.


@] Memory Management for Strings in Java

Java handles String memory efficiently using two main areas:

1️⃣ String Pool (String Constant Pool - SCP)

 - Stored in the heap but separately managed by JVM.
 - When you create a string using literals, JVM first checks if it already exists in the pool.
 - If it exists, reference is reused (no new object is created).
 - If it doesn’t exist, JVM creates a new object in the pool.

 String s1 = "Java";
 String s2 = "Java";  // Reuses the same object from SCP

 System.out.println(s1 == s2);  // true (same reference)



2️⃣ Heap Memory

 - When you use new String(), JVM always creates a new object in the heap.
 - Even if the same value exists in SCP, a separate object is made in heap memory.
